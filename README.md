# Visitor Ride Management System

## Project Overview

This project simulates a **Visitor Ride Management System**, where you can manage visitors, perform health checks, run amusement rides, and generate reports. The system integrates health data from a simulated platform and wearable devices to determine whether visitors are fit to take a ride.

### Key Features:
- **Visitor Management**: Add, remove, and manage visitors in the queue.
- **Health Check**: Check if visitors are fit to take the ride based on simulated health data (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels).
- **Ride Management**: Manage the queue for rides, check if visitors are fit, run the ride, and maintain ride history.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize ride usage, health check pass rates, and age distribution.
- **Report Generation**: Generate reports with visitor health data and ride statistics.
- **File Handling**: Save and load visitor data from files for persistence.

## Features

1. **Visitor Health Check**: Simulate fetching health data from external sources.
2. **Ride Queue Management**: Add visitors to the ride queue based on health status and run the ride.
3. **Data Visualization**: Bar charts and statistical data for better ride and visitor analysis.
4. **Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports including health status and ride history.
